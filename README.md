# Refactor Udemy Course Source Code: 
## Course: "Ethereum and Solidity The Complete Developers Guide" by Stephen
#### The author's source code is using old web3 pakcages. Spent time to use web3js 4 and make all the projects runnable!

## The final big kickstart project has no source code here (since the his code is using too old version of nextjs or web3). Please refer to my another repository kickstart-next, which I spent time and used latest Next.js and solc package to compile the smartcontract and build the full featured Campaign project like the author demoed.
